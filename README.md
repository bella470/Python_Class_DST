# Data Science Course with Python

I am enrolled in a Data Science Analyst course at PEOPLElogy. Here are the notes from all my classes, which can be shared and referred to by anyone in need. As my trainer mentioned, these notes will serve as a valuable cheat sheet throughout the journey in Data Science.

Feel free to let me know if you need any additional revisions or if there is more content you'd like to refine!

All of these codes are done via Google Colab.
